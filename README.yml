         Recommendation Systems are being used all over the web. There are different
         popular techniques that are being used in modern systems. Some of the larger
         well know companies are using this technology very well. This material is
         an overview of some techniques, state of the art systems, and challenges
         and limitations of Recommendation Systems.

         Computer security threats and attacks are constantly evolving. Everyday, 
         hackers are creating new techniques to bypass
         network security for the purpose of malicious attacks.
         To keep up with the changing intrusion technologies, the technologies 
         that defend these attacks need to constantly evolve also. Modern day
         technologies use deep learning techniques to monitor 
         network activity, and detect malicious code. We will
         provide an overview of network security and modern technologies being 
         used to protect computer systems and networks.
